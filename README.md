# Playing-Card-Shuffler
This project is my answer to the Robots and Pencils Coding Challenge.

 Using:
 
 Node.JS,
 Express,
 NPM Request,
 NPM Fs,
 JavaScript,
 Bootstrap,
 CSS,
 HTML,
 
 this app will query Deck of Cards API and return an image link to be displayed.
 
 Selecting the Single Card button will route to /singlecard and will display one card.
 
 Selecting the All the Cards button will route to /allcards and will display all the shuffled cards.
